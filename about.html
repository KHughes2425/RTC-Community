        </h1>
        <p>The RealTime Community Education Special Interest Group (RTS Education SIG) is a dynamic
             platform designed to foster connections between members of the Real-Time Community (RTC) industry and academic partners. 
             Our primary goal is to cultivate mutually beneficial partnerships while facilitating the exchange and promotion of educational 
             programs and resources. The RTS Education Committee is dedicated to a wide array of initiatives aimed at strengthening the RTC 
             industry pipeline, with a specific focus on Real-Time technologies, including Virtual Production. These endeavors encompass 
             developing curriculum guidelines, offering instructional resources, organizing educational conferences, and engaging in outreach 
             activities.
